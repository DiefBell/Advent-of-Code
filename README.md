Errr... So this is for Advent of code 2024.
The idea is to do a different language per day
(sometimes if I don't have much time to faff I'll just go for TypeScript.)

Read the readmes, they generally help.
I haven't added notes for C# because cba,
but basically if you want to do a different day then you've gotta gen a new project with the `dotnet` CLI.

#### Dev Container
To make it less hellish to start using each language,
we use a VSCode dev container, which is just a Docker container that has everything set up.
To get started:
- Have Docker installed and running;
- Open the command palette;
- Install the `Dev Containers` VSCode extension;
- Select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`;
- ???
- Profit
